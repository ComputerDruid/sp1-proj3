SP1 Project 3
=============
Dan Johnson
Dean Knight

Approach
--------
This program is divided into 3 parts. The standalone bootstrap program we used
without modifications. The OS/driver code, which deals with hardware interfacing
and interrupts, is composed of the "sio", "sleep", "io", and "timer". The user
code is responsible for driving the watch, and is made up of the "watch",
"time", and "mystery". Finally, "main" defines the entry point into the system.

Division of Labor
-----------------
During the system design and hardware interface portion of the project, we both
worked on the project together and at the same time. So both the "sio" module
and the "timer" module were written collaboratively.

Dan implemented the io abstraction framework and the mystery handler. Dean
implemented the alarm functionality and the time/string handling functions. Dan
implemented the stopwatch mode, and refined the sio framework to be
asynchronous using a circular buffer.

We spent most of our debugging time together and both collaborated to put the
finishing touches (including comments and README) together.

Final Thoughts
--------------
Getting the sio_polled example to work took some extra initialization which was
not in the example code, so the example should probably be updated to include
an update to the modem control register, as this took us some time to figure
out.

We found this project to be a good experience, and enjoyed it.
